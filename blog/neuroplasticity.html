        If you've ever wanted to learn anything... anything, neuroplasticity, is the process in the brain we use to learn and adapt. One of the most successful traits of human, adaptation. Now, just like when learning to ride a bike, the beginning was difficult, but we kept on trying until riding a bike became 'second-nature'. Essentially through continued stimuli or repeated action we can learn anything!

      <h4>What does it do?</h4>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is activity driven, and follows the mantra of <em><spans class="make-it-medium">use it or lose it. </spans></em>
        <br> The 'use it lose it' saying describes what happens within our learning centres. If we practice anything repeatedly, the amount of time we spend on that subject allows our brain easier access to the subject, like a library of the brain, more references with a greater understanding of the subject.
        <br>A common way to understand what is going on with neuroplasticity, is to think of an expressway. The more we use the road, the stronger the foundation is, the stronger and smoother the expressway is.

        <br> And so too with our mind, the more time and effort we put into an activity, the stronger and faster the connections in our brain become with larger mind-pathways to travel down. But if we don't use the road anymore, over time these roads will become unfamiliar. Until, the point if we travel them again, we may not recall where they go.

      <h4>How does it do it?</h4>
      <p>
        The response of the brain is to produce new pathways and provide additional receptors to receive more signals. This also means, if we spend less time on a subject our responses decrease and our brain allocates less receptors to manage that activity. The ability of the brain to evolve in response to an environment.
      </p>
      <h4>The good and bad..</h4>
      <p>
        This process touches everyone. Often showcased for the positive effects neuroplasticity can have on a person and their ability to learn. It has been linked with rehabilitation in many areas of health. However, this process is largely about our reward centres. This in turn can mean, those in our society with less support, may turn to substances to dampen their life experiences, neuroplasticity will also respond to this environement.

      <h4>Growth mindset vs Fixed mindset</h4>
      <p>
        These two mindsets are very powerful. From doing everything you want, to doing none of it.
        <br>Your mindset dictates how you see the world. 
        <br>A growth mindset will allow you to see an opportunity in the learning, even if it seems difficult and challenging. This is often what continues the growth mindset, is the challenge it takes up, but keeping on going.
        <br>Where-as a fixed mindset will not believe they are capable enough to get through. They'll give up. The messeging they relay to themselves is often a "I could never do that, my brain doesn't work that way". Well actually, your brain may just be untrained in that area, cause yes, yes it does work that way!
        Our mindset is super powerful. If you say you can't, then you wont. But if you say you can, and are willing to apply yourself, you will achieve.
