    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
  <p>
    Relearning how much the ego can hold you back. A rather large struggle for me was me asking for help when needed.  
    Being too prideful can really be a waste of time. 
    <br>Recognising and becoming aware of my current habits has been a long work-on for me. However, during foundations I felt this process of self-awareness demanding my attention, and the small mirco-wins of setting intentions and following through on things / anything helps. Not necessarily solving everything at once, but little by little improvements to how I will acheive goals are happening with the time I  am giving to them. 
    
  </p>
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
  <p>

    The roles of each are paramount to how you hold yourself and work towards anything. Having awareness of self allows you to at least notice what the body is trying to tell you. Being aware of self and having empathy, empathy for ourselves first, allows us to further understand what empathy for others could be. 
    <br>And with understanding, the values I hold close to me, are demostrated in the life i want to lead, and the people I want to be surrounded by.
  </p>
    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
  <p>
    My surprises tend to be in the thinking around the industry and industry culture.
    <br>By having focus placed within these skills, there is recognition of working environment, a good team culture increases productivity and in general, if people are more content in their work, they feel engouraged to do a good job, and receive satisfaction from doing their job well. Benefits all around.

    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

  <p>
    During foundations, and in regards to core learning, the most difficult  part was trying to build rapport through our computer and/ or phone screens. It was and still is a bit difficult to talk about myself and to publish blogs with my own writing is rare.
  </p>
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
  <p>
    This to me highlights a need for a better or clearer level of communication within a tech industry. Using our most advanced and sometimes least understood technology - ourselves/ our body! 
    <br>Learning code, whilst daunting at first, is a skillset that can be built upon with regular and sustained consistency. 
    <br>However when I am in touch with what is going on within my body, this allows more calm, and thoughtful responses. Putting oneself first is a necessity if you are to grow yourself. 
  </p>
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to 
    practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
  <p>
    I see this time as being appropriate. If what is being sought is a safer working environment for all. If i feel safe in a working environment, I am more likely to contribute.  
    If the intent is to graduate programmers with high levels of emotional intelligence, this may then also allow a developer to have the end user in mind, whilst also being in a working environment
