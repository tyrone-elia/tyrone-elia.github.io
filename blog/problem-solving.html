        Early on the issues were very simple. "I didn't understand the question." All the words in the questions were known to me, but in that configuration, told me nothing. Too long had I been staring, willing the answers out of the void. 
        <br> Now, I still don't really know much about much... but quickly we start using all the tools close at hand.
        <br><em>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</em> 
        <br>
        Regularly now, my first instinct is to try something out, see if an idea can build and move closer to a solution. The language is more deciperable, patterns emerging. With even basic understanding, knowing how to run through checks. Reading and comprhending <em>error messages</em>, utilising <em>console.log</em>.  Console.log is super-dupa useful!

        <em>Pseudocode</em>, the benefits are immediate with the unraveling of the question. Being aware of the language allows us to be succinct when converting functional terminology to general speak. Still a skill I am needing to practice. But essentially, as Einstein said(not verbatim) "if you cant explain an idea simply, you dont really understand it." 
        <br>
        <br>Currenty house sitting, so my adopted dog 'Greta', has been hearing a lot of my stories. <em>The Rubber Ducky Method</em> is tried and true. Just saying the idea out loud is a good way to clarify your thinking. I have also been writing some pseudocode on a white-board if things were taking too long. In an effort to get the thinking out of me on a surface I can then talk to, and often build ideas from there.
        <br><em>How did you feel throughout the process?</em>
        <br>Initally apprehensive and worried I would not be able to comprehend and keep up. A few very slow painful days of zero-understanding. But continued time on the subject matter, small cogs are turning! Recognition of what I am looking at has been a nice feeling. Getting results from just trying something out, great. One big learning or realisation for me, was witnessing the many ways a problem can be solved.

        In terms of <em>elegance</em>, looking at the arrow function expressions and trying to get same results through other means. A couple of instances have left me exclaiming out loud "wow, that was cool!." And a pleasing feeling when I see what clean code or smart code looks like.
        <br>Getting better at <em>asking others for help.</em> Getting a better understanding of the language, this then allows me to search clearer keywords in <em>google</em>, so my results are a little more hit than miss.
        <br>
        <br>
        The reality is I use each of these types of problem-solving techniques either by themselves or in conjuction to try and solve problems. The work on is to increase the repitition of using all of these techniques, to find what works besrt for me.
