      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h3>
      <p>
        Discovering behaviour about individuals I held as friends. The behaviours demonstrated
         by these individuals go against values I hold. The decision was a simple, but very hard one
          to make. I now don't interact with these people, which is sad but needed. 
          I cannot condone certain actions of people, and endevour to do better and speak up, when 
          I see or feel instances where action is required.

      <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
      <p>My culture... What is 'my' culture? New Zealand culture? Aotearoa?? Pacific Islander?? <br>
        A good question really, and a somewhat triggering question in many ways. <br>Born in Auckland, 
        New Zealand. My mother, a 7th gen New Zealander with roots going back to early settlers of 
        Poverty Bay. My father, a 1st gen New Zealander with predominintly Cook Island roots. <br>
        I have grown up in NZ as a double-caste (or half-caste - an antiquated term referring to an 
        indivdual being half-pure blood) Kiwi-Cook Islander. Meaning, growing up in NZ I've either 
        been too brown for the whities or, too white for the brownies. <br>
        The reclamation of identity, culture or lack of is part of what has no doubt influenced my
        values to-date. I have grown up around and within bigoted views all my life. Which is/ was 
        often hard when those views held and spoken of, are/were views directly against me. Culture of what...

      <h3>Strengths and limitations - learning and career development</h3>
      <p>Over the past few (6ish) years, I have been on a journey of learning, with an intention of
        designing the lifestyle I want live.  
        Pervious experience within middle management and various BA (business analyst) roles, with a 
        focus on process improvement. 
        Strengths in conversational placement - tailoring language to converse with various people, 
        at their own percieved levels of importance. Also strengths in societal-situational understanding.
        I have and do rub shoulders with Corporate CEO's and gangsters - both earning millions just breaking
        different sets of rules. Who writes these laws and who do they serve...?
        Limitations revolve around my aversion to corporate environments. My experience, the mindset of 
        corporate is money. 
        For good or bad, I am an anarchist. This current system does not work for most. So I spend my 
        time imagining what could be, and what can i do now, to influence a future for those to come...?

      <h3>Share an example from an experience</h3>
      <p>2 years ago I formed a band. This band was made up of actors. They had not really been within 
        the band environment before and this was a new setting for them. Although their musical ability 
        was still at a high level. 
        The tension I discovered recently, was two fold… in one way, these young actors have always 
        had the privilege to take up space and time for themselves to focus on what they need personally. 
        Growing up… I was not allowed to do this. My childhood was more about being shushed and invisible. 
        These are really big learnings for me. I have recognised this tension was both my inability to 
        take up others time, and my reactions to others taking up everyones time. 
        These have been difficult to accept, but I feel are good learnings for me moving forward.
