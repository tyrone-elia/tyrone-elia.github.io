      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h3>
      <p>
        Discovering behaviour about individuals I held as friends. The behaviours demonstrated
         by these individuals go against values I hold. The decision was a simple, but very hard one
          to make. I now don't interact with these people, which is sad but needed. 
          I cannot condone certain actions of people, and endevour to do better and speak up, when 
          I see or feel instances where action is required.

      <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
      <p>My culture... What is 'my' culture? New Zealand culture? Aotearoa?? Pacific Islander??
        <br>A good question really, and a somewhat triggering question. 
        <br>Born in Auckland, New Zealand. My mother, a 7th gen New Zealander with roots going back to early settlers of Poverty Bay. My father, a 1st gen New Zealander from Kūki 'Āirani (The Cook Islands). 
        <br>The reclamation of culture, identity or lack of is part of my influences and values to-date.

      <h3>Strengths and limitations - learning and career development</h3>
      <p>
        In recent years, I have been on a journey of learning, with an intention of designing the lifestyle I want to lead. Pervious experience within middle management and various BA (business analyst) roles, with a focus on process improvement. Strengths in conversational placement - tailoring language to converse with various people, in an effort to build rapport. Passionate about creating and building ideas.
        Limitations: Refocusing the brain for new style of learning. Past experiences have left a negative tinge to how I see some working environments. Getting too comfortable in solutude. A current major work on in regards to limitations is building and sticking to a basic routine.

      <h3>Share an example from an experience</h3>
      <p>
        2 years ago I formed a band. This band was made up of actors. They had not really been within 
        the band environment before and this was a new setting for them. Although their musical ability 
        was still at a high level. 
        The tension I discovered recently, was two fold… in one way, these actors have always 
        had the privilege to take up space and time for themselves to focus on what they need personally. 
        Growing up… I was not allowed to do this. My childhood was more about being shushed and invisible. 
        These are really big learnings for me. I have recognised this tension was both my inability to 
        take up others time, and my reactions to others taking up everyones time. 
        These have been difficult to accept, but I feel are good learnings for me moving forward.
