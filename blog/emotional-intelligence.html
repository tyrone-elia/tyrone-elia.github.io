  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  <p>
    Emotional Intelligence..  starts with how we interact with ourselves. Being aware of how you, the indivdual reacts to stimuli, being able to recognise when you have a strong emotional response, and then knowing your required action to remain safe in your own body. This then flows into the ability for some to recognise emotion within others, and again being aware of how stimuli can either elevate or relax emotional responses.
  </p>
  <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
  <p>
    IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. Often logic does not take into consideration emotion, and therefore a logical response to some situations can be received as cold or uncaring.
  </p>
  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>
    The difference is super important. Being a part of a team or group environment with many different perspectives can and will lead to disagreements. Alternate viewpoints are not the issue, often it is how these viewpoints are explained and reponded to. If you don't quite understand how damaging words are, the way those words are delivered, you may come across issues you weren't even aware of. Diverse thinking on a subject is best to build with.
