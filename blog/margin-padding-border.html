    <h3>Simply put... the differences are fairly simple between the margin, padding and the border.</h3>
    <p>The margin surrounds the border, the padding surrounds the content, and the border sits inbetween the margin and the padding.</p>

    <h3>Margin</h3>
    <p>The margin is a CSS property used to create space around the element, outside of the border. In other words the margin creates a gap around the border by 'pushing' the content away. It's always outside the border. The values of margin used can be auto, length, %, or inherit. Worth noting, the margin has no colour.</p>

    <h3>Padding</h3>
    <p>Padding is the space inside the content area. It acts like a cushion between the content and the border. Padding is what creates a space inside the element and allows the content space to breath. The values of margin used can be auto, </p>

    <h3>Border</h3>
    <p>The border is the space in-between the margin and padding. If you can imagine being at the top of a 3 step high pyrimid; the top step or landing is where the most important information is held and observed. From here you can see everything. The first step down would be the padding. A space or area seperating the main information by making the top layer visable. A step further down, is the border. This is the closest step to the ground. And finally the ground, the area surrounding the pyrimid, would act as the margin. You cant really see that the ground level is part of the pyrimid, but without it, you would be on the first step. So the margin also highlights that there is a first step or border!</p>
