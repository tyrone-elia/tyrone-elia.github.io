      <p>Talking about <em><spans class="make-it-medium">html, CSS and Javascript.</spans></em>  What springs to mind for me, is if we have <img class='mini-image right-align-image' src="../images/eengin-akyurt-_Pj2sCx9UB4-unsplash.jpg">a look at the common car. We can envisage a base level, made up of many different bits and parts, attached to our chassis. <em><spans class="make-it-medium">This is our Html level.</spans></em> Html is like our foundation: the chassis, the windows, the engine, and all the bits and parts that make a car a car. 
    <img class="smaller-image left-align-image" src="../images/mateusz-suski-nnZ6ORmjmew-unsplash.jpg" alt="chassis"> <br><br>
  
    The next level to look at revolves around <em><spans class="make-it-medium">what we look at!</spans></em> How our car looks and feels on the outside and on the inside!!!

    <img class='tiny-image left-align-image' src="../images/jessica-knowlden-VcHU3hC_lAM-unsplash.jpg">
    The colour of the whole and of each part, the style, textures inside and outside the car, add to the whole experience of the cars aesthetic. <br><em><spans class="make-it-medium">This is our CSS level</spans></em> <br>A new set of rims, a roof rack, just a light touch of style added to our car.
    <img class='smaller-image right-align-image' src="../images/nick-fewings-zMQJxGndFd0-unsplash.jpg">
    But can make our experience in the car very different. So far we have all of the bits and pieces to make this car work and look good doing it. 
    <br><br>Then we come to our connector, activator and/or smarts. The advances in car mechanics and technology. Taking our basic mechanical setup and applying intelligent thinking to it.
