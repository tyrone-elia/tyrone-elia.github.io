  My career pathway revolves around quality of life. In recent years, I've been educating myself around my interests. And this has lead me on this journey with Dev Academy. 
</p>

<p>
  I am hoping my <em>strengths</em> around process development (part of my old job) will help in my learning. The <em>limitations</em> I am focusing on during bootcamp are around habits. What I am needing to show consistency in and what habits I need to unlearn.
</p>

<p>
  During my time at Dev Academy I would like to develop my reflective practice skills, and my communication.

<p>
  This learning is an intesive into a subject. Being able keep moving forward, asking questions and seeking help when stuck is the commitment I am making to ensure I  acheive what I have set out to do.

<h3>What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>
  There are some real opportunites arising from the learning I am currently undertaking. A lot of personal growth during the last half decade. Awareness.. With my most recent years being around learning environments and upskilling myself, a major focus currently is my ability to build habits. With routine and structure surrounding my (self-analysed) chaotic mind, I feel this is an important focus for me. With this, recognising small additions and learnings, made consistent, will create sustained benefits and internal growth.

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload during this programme.</h3>
<p>
  This flows on from the last question. Holding myself accountable and being able to ask for help. These are the biggest work ons for me. This is my commitment. To ask for help when I need it. The other commitment, is my individual practice around forming meaningful habits.

<!-- An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
-->

<h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>
  The only thing I require from a facilitation team is communication. With great comms, we can move and 
  change more effectively!!!
