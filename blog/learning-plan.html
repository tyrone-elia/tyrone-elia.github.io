<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>
  The current trajectory in terms of career is for me about the quality of life. 
  <br> I don't believe in the term work/life balance, It's just life.
   I was sold the lie, that money was the answer. So I tried to be an analyst. And was one...for around 
   10 years. A couple years ago, I graduated from acting school. My career path moving forward is about 
   quality of life. I've always loved and had enjoyment in the arts. And this is the area of thinking I 
   am leaning into . With an eye always on creative outlets, and this new skillset I see as enabling my 
   creativity, the obvious blending of art and tech is on my mind. 
   Combining those interests, from music, theatre, movement, film, and other interests like traveling 
   and experiencing other cultures, I am excited at the imagery I am creating and manifesting for myself
    and whanau.

<h3>What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>There are some real opportunites arising from the learning I am currently undertaking. A lot
  of personal growth during the last half decade. <br>
  Awareness.. With my most recent years being around learning environments and upskilling myself, 
  a major focus currently is my ability to build habits. With routine and structure surrounding 
  my (self-analysed) chaotic mind, I feel this is an important focus for me. With this, recognising 
  small additions and learnings, made consistent, will create sustained benefits and internal growth. 
</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload during this programme.</h3>
<p>This flows on from the last question. Holding myself accountable and being able to ask for help. 
These are the biggest work ons for me. 
This is my commitment. To ask for help when I need it. 
The other commitment, is my individual practice around forming meaningful habits. 
Essentially, the matra - master of self, is the outcome I am working towards.

<h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>The only thing I require from a facilitation team in communication. With great comms, we can move and 
  change at a quick pace!!! </p>
